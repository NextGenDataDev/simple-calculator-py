simple-calculator-py

A beginner-friendly Python calculator that handles everyday math without stress. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, modulo, floor division, square, square root, and includes basic error handling so the program doesn’t fall apart when things get chaotic.

Features
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exponents
6. Modulo
7. Floor Division
8. Square
9. Square Root
10. Error Handling for invalid input

How It Works
The calculator runs directly in your terminal. You enter two numbers, choose an operation, and it prints the result neatly. If you enter something wild (like a letter instead of a number), it guides you back on track instead of crashing.

How to Run It
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/NextGenDataDev/simple-calculator-py.git
4. Navigate into the folder:
   cd simple-calculator-py
5. Run the script:
   python new.py

Why I Built This
This is a starter project for practicing Python basics, logical thinking, and writing clean functions. It’s simple but sharp, and a great first step toward more advanced programming and data science projects.

Future Improvements
1. Add a GUI version
2. Allow continuous calculations
3. Add history tracking
4. Build a packaged version that can be installed with pip
